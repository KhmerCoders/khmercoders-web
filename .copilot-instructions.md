# KhmerCoders Web - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js application for the KhmerCoders community platform built with TypeScript, using Drizzle ORM with SQLite (via Cloudflare D1), and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Database Schema Location
**Primary Schema File**: `src/libs/db/schema.ts`

This file contains all database table definitions using Drizzle ORM for SQLite. Check this file to understand the current database structure and available tables.

## Server Actions Examples
**Actions Directory**: `src/server/actions/`

For examples of how to implement server actions, refer to these files:
- `src/server/actions/likes.ts` - Example of simple CRUD operations with atomic updates
- `src/server/actions/follower.ts` - Example of relationship management with batch operations

All server actions use the `withAuthAction` middleware wrapper and follow consistent patterns for authentication, error handling, and database operations.
